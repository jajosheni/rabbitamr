= Mapping types:

== Gmapping
* It unnecessarily increases the size of the map
* odom is more important
* can correct itself
* Can erase obstacles that were there before
* performance: good

== Karto
* Keeps the size of the map pretty small
* Laser data is more important
* it gets lost harder but when it does it destroys the map
* hardly erases obstacles that were before
* When the amcl runs it creates 1m offset according to x (wrongly saves the origin)
* performance : medium

== Hector
* It produces the map size in a fixed way, if it surpasses the real world it does not record anything.
* Uses laser data and odom at the same level of importance
* The position of the robot is constantly changing in Rviz, vibrating
* performance: medium

== Cartographer
* The map size is pretty small
* Adds obstacles very confidently, but erases the edges of some small objects
* Can use imu as well as laser scan and odom
* performance: good
